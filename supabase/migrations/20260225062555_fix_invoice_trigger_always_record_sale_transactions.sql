/*
  # Fix: Invoice trigger must ALWAYS record sale transactions
  
  ROOT CAUSE: The trigger `trg_sales_invoice_item_inventory` skips creating 
  inventory_transactions when the invoice item has a delivery_challan_item_id.
  This meant all DC-linked sales were invisible in transaction history.
  
  THE FIX:
  - Always record a sale transaction regardless of whether item came from DC or manual entry
  - DC-linked items: stock was already deducted when DC was approved, so we only log the transaction
  - Manual items: deduct stock AND log transaction (unchanged behavior)
  
  BACKFILL:
  - Insert missing sale transactions for all existing DC-linked invoice items
